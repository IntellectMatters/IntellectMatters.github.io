            Hi guys, so as literally nobody knows I have recently been getting into philosophy, so this is my first little philosophy project.
            I decided to write it about my STRONGEST belief, that Intellect Matters.
            However, I will also cover how intelligence can be a curse, making you an outcast, or "nerd."
            This WILL be migrated to another domain (intellectmatters.com) once I get my server(s) back up.

            Intelligence is not only a gift, but a curse. Arthur Schopenhauer, "the Most Pessimistic Philosopher," once said "For the more somebody has in himself, the less he needs from the outside and the less others can be to him. Therefore, intellectual distinction leads to unsociability." This, in a summary, means that knowledge does not liberate people, but it isolates them. Intelligence is truly a gift and a curse at the same time. I have ended many friendships due to the other party having a lack of intelligence. While that does sound extremely egotistical, I know it is true. I get burnt out trying to dumb down what I say. Back on track, many people are a hivemind. The "crowd" according to Schopenhauer. For example, the group of girls who all wear the exact same outfit, or boys who haven't had reality hit them yet. Think of the most annoying person you know, my best guess is that they are unintelligent. Unintelligent people serve zero purpose to this world, if you cannot comprehend why you are doing something, why do it? If you fail to understand why you are doing "grunt" work, and all you see it as is a source of income, you are unintelligent. I think "hate" is an extremely strong, and powerful word, but the only thing I KNOW I hate is stupid people. Again, extremely egotistical, I know. If people can't get your and you're right, I lose my mind. It genuinely is irritating. If I get called unintelligent, why do I get offended, when REAL unintelligent people just brush it off? Because Intellect Matters, you need to be intelligent to understand how miserable unintelligence is. Joe Bartolozzi, popular Twitch streamer and Philosophy Major once said "You only know what it's like to be fucking sad because you know what it's like to be happy." I think that strongly applies to this, you only know what it's like to be unintelligent, because you know what it's like to be intelligent. Intelligence comes with ego, ego comes with hatred, hatred comes with unintelligence, why is this? The true answer is, I have no clue.
